{-| A representation of a [keyboard event][keyboard-event].
The `key` field may or may not be present, depending on the listener ("keydown"
vs. "keypress" vs. "keyup"), browser, and key pressed (character key vs.
special key). If not present, it will be `Nothing` here.
The `keyCode` is normalized by `decodeKeyboardEvent` to use whichever of
`which`, `keyCode` or `charCode` is provided, and made type-safe via
`Keyboard.Key`
(see the excellent [SwiftsNamesake/proper-keyboard][proper-keyboard-pkg] for
further manipulation of a `Key`).

{-| You provide a function which, given a `KeyboardEvent`, turns it into a
message your `update` function can handle. You get back a `Decoder` for those
messages.
When your function returns `Nothing`, the decoder will fail. This means that
the event will simply be ignored -- that is, it will not reach your `update`
function at all.
Essentially, this allows you to filter keyboard events inside the decoder
itself, rather than in the `update` function. Whether this is a good idea or
not will depend on your scenario.
