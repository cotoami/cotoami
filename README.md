## Run application on localhost

If you have a Docker environment running (`docker info` outputs some info), just execute the following command:

```
$ ./launch-on-local.sh
...
[info] Running Cotoami.Endpoint with Cowboy using http://localhost:4000
[info] Running migrations on start...
[info] Already up
...
```

Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser.

### Dummy mail server

There should be a line like `You can check sign-up/in mails at <url>` in the output log.
You can access the test mail server via the `<url>` to check sign-up/in mails.
